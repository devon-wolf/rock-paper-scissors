# rock-paper-scissors

## Plan
I need:
- styled radio buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors
- button to trigger computer throw
	- `computerThrow` function to generate rock, paper, or scissors throw for the computer player
	- `doesUserWin` function to figure out if the user's throw beats the computer's throw
- area to display computer's throw
- area to display win/lose message
- area to display recorded wins and losses
- Global State Items:
	- wins
	- losses

### HTML Setup
- Basic layout (title/header/sections/etc)
- Explanation of rules
- 3 name-grouped radio buttons
- 1 trigger button
- at least 2 display areas for results
